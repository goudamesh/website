# Join In

Would you like to become part of a local, independent network? Joining **GoudaMesh** is entirely voluntary and revolves around your own initiative. Whether you are a tech enthusiast or just curious about wireless technology: anyone can contribute to the coverage in and around Gouda.

## How to get started?

1.  **Discover the world of Meshtastic:** Dive into the online documentation of the global [Meshtastic project](https://meshtastic.org). Here you will find everything about the technology, the required software, and how to get started independently with this open-source platform.
2.  **Place your own node:** The strength of the network lies in its distribution. By installing a node (a small device with an antenna) on your windowsill, balcony, or roof, you become a link in the network. Popular and affordable hardware for this includes Heltec V3 or WisBlock modules.
3.  **Experiment and share:** GoudaMesh is a playground for mesh networks. Test how far your signal reaches in the city, try out different antennas, or build a solar-powered node. By simply keeping your node 'on air', you help map the possibilities in Gouda.

> **Experimenting together:** GoudaMesh is an open initiative. There are no obligations and no central organization; the network grows organically through the active contribution of everyone who places a node.

## Look Further

Some people share their experiments and questions on Discord. This is not a requirement, but it can be useful if you want to follow along or ask something.
