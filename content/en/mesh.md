# Mesh

Imagine something like WhatsApp or Messenger, but without the need for a cell tower, Wi-Fi, or a phone subscription. That is essentially what **[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)** is.

Here is a brief explanation for those who aren't tech experts:

## What is it?

Meshtastic is a system that allows you to share text messages and your location using small, affordable radio transmitters. These devices connect to your smartphone via Bluetooth, but then use their own radio signal to send messages over distances of several kilometers.

## What makes it so special?

The uniqueness lies in the word **'Mesh'**:

*   **Stronger together:** Every active transmitter acts as a relay station. If you send a message to someone who is too far away, another transmitter nearby will pick it up and automatically pass it on. This way, we build our own free network together.
*   **No central authority:** There is no company (like KPN or Google) in charge. The network belongs to the users themselves.
*   **Privacy:** All messages are encrypted by default. No one can read them except the person the message is intended for.

## When would you use this?

You might wonder: "Don't I already have 5G?" True, but Meshtastic is the perfect backup or addition for:

*   **In nature:** While hiking or skiing in areas where you have no cell service.
*   **Large events:** At festivals where mobile networks are often overloaded.
*   **Emergencies:** If the power goes out or the phone network goes down due to a failure.
*   **Off-grid hobby:** Simply because it's fun to be independent of large telecom corporations.

## What do you need?

To join, you buy a small transmitter (often no bigger than a lighter) for about €30 to €50. It doesn't require a SIM card, and you never pay any subscription fees.
