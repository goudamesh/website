# Contact

**GoudaMesh** is a non-profit hobby project born out of a passion for technology and local connectivity.

Do you have a great idea for an experiment, want to suggest a collaboration, or just want to let us know that you've put a node 'on air'? We’d love to hear from you! You can find us on the [GoudaMesh Discord server](https://discord.gg/7rMvZNnKKb) or, of course, send us a message via the local Meshtastic network.

You can also email us at [goudamesh@proton.me](mailto:goudamesh@proton.me)

Good to know: Since this is a small-scale initiative run in our spare time, we do not have a helpdesk. For technical questions about hardware, installation, or troubleshooting, we refer you to the extensive [Meshtastic Documentation](https://meshtastic.org/docs/introduction/) or the global [Meshtastic Discord server](https://discord.gg/meshtastic).
