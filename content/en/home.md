# Welcome to GoudaMesh

A local initiative inviting you to experiment with mesh networks in and around Gouda.

## What is GoudaMesh?

**GoudaMesh** is a local initiative aimed at making mesh networks in the city visible and understandable. We are not an official network with a helpdesk, but rather a showcase for anyone who wants to experiment with open and decentralized communication in Gouda.

Our focus is on **[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)**: small radio transmitters (nodes) that talk directly to each other. Together, they form a private network, completely independent of the internet, without subscriptions or central providers.

## Why mesh networks?

*   **Completely independent:** It always works, even without cell towers or a functioning internet connection.
    
*   **Privacy by design:** Messages are encrypted. No data is collected or tracked.
    
*   **Stronger together:** Every new node in the city increases the range and resilience of the network for everyone.
    

## Who is this for?

For every curious resident of Gouda. Whether you love technology or are just curious about how we can stay connected as a city independently: interest is the only requirement.

## Want to join?

Start small and at your own pace. Think of it as a digital playground for the city. There are no obligations; discovery and experimentation are key.
